#Reblog

Reblog is a Movable Type plugin that parses Atom and RSS feeds and transforms
feed entries into Movable Type entries. Imports can be run either manually or
in the background using
[run-periodic-tasks](http://www.movabletype.org/documentation/administrator/setting-up-run-periodic-taskspl.html).

# Dependencies

Reblog supports the following versions of Movable Type:

* Movable Type 4.25+
* Movable Type 5.1+

## Additional Perl Module Requirements

In addition to the
[System Requirements](http://www.movabletype.org/documentation/system-requirements.html)

  running unit tests.
